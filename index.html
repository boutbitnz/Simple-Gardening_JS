              Harvesting You'r Herbs;
              Herbs will thrive if picked often. It is a good idea to pluck before flowers start or as soon. This meaning, nip the buds, the tip or flower part of 
              stem. Doing so will help prevent the Herb from growing to fast causing lack of flavor.

              It's a very good idea to comsider Raised beds when planting 
              Vegetable. The spacing really matters, such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a microclimate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved. Raised beds produce a variety of benefits: they extend the planting season, they can reduce weeds if designed and planted properly, and they reduce the need to use poor native soil. Since the gardener does not walk on the raised beds, the soil is not compacted and the roots have an easier time growing.

              Raised Beds;
                Are created by building wide, flat top rows about 2ft wide and   
                    6in high.
                  The soil is raised above the surrounding soil.
