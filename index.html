              It's a very good idea to consider Raised beds when planting
              Vegetable. The spacing really matters, such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a micro climate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved. Raised beds produce a variety of benefits: they extend the planting season, they can reduce weeds if designed and planted properly, and they reduce the need to use poor native soil. Since the gardener does not walk on the raised beds, the soil is not compacted and the roots have an easier time growing.

              Raised Beds;
              Are created by building wide, flat top rows about 2 ft wide and
              in high.
              The soil is raised above the surrounding soil.

              It's a very good idea to consider Raised beds when planting
              Vegetable. The spacing really matters, such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a micro climate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved. Raised beds produce a variety of benefits: they extend the planting season, they can reduce weeds if designed and planted properly, and they reduce the need to use poor native soil. Since the gardener does not walk on the raised beds, the soil is not compacted and the roots have an easier time growing.

              Raised Beds;
              Are created by building wide, flat top rows about 2 ft wide and
              6 inch high.
              The soil is raised above the surrounding soil.

            </p>

              <li id = "tomatoeDirt">
                <h4>
                  VEGGIES / DIRT
                </h4>
                <p>

                  Must have good, loamy, well drained soil.
                  Veggies love rich and nutrient dirt.
                  It's a good idea to build raised beds for your veggies
                  to insure supportive drainage and fast warmth.

                  Tomatoes - When it comes to heat, this veggies can handle it all. Don't worry much about too much sun.
                  Veggies love lots of sun!
                  To grow properly and to provide the most, Veggies need 6 hours of direct sunlight,
                  preferably 8 hours.

                </p>
              </li>

                  Tomatoes - 1 inch water a week. A little more if hot or dry.
